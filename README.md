# Automatic Soil Testing using AI

This repo contains the project files for 'Automatic soil testing using AI'. It has divided into two section as :
<ol>
  <li> First section contains the dataset information and is implemented in 'Dataset intro.ipynb' file. It contains the explanation
    and preprocessing of data.
  <li> Second section contains the implementation of various models on preprocessed data. The models that are implemented are:
    <ol>
      <li> Lasso </li>
      <li> Ridge </li>
      <li> Linear Model </li>
      <li> Support Vector Regressor (Linear) </li>
      <li> Support Vector Regressor (Poly) </li>
      <li> Neural Network </li>
      <li> Decision Tree Regressor </li>
      <li> Random Forest Regressor </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li> Third and last section contains the GUI application using Tkinter in python. This interface takes various attributes of soil from user and predict the output. </li>
  </ol>
